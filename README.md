**Azure Cognitive Search vs Vector Database. When to use and How?**

Here's a comparison table highlighting when to use Azure Cognitive Search and Vector Database (e.g., Redis with a vector search module or Pinecone) in an Azure OpenAI architecture:

*In an Azure OpenAI architecture scenario, use Azure Cognitive Search when:*

1. You require advanced search capabilities, such as faceting, filtering, and scoring, for full-text search and rich queries.
2. You need rich text analysis features, like tokenization, stemming, and synonym mapping.
3. You are looking for native integration with Azure services, including Azure OpenAI.
4. Your use case involves e-commerce product search, document search and indexing, or faceted navigation for complex data.

*Use a Vector Database (Redis or Pinecone) when:*

1. You need vector similarity search for high-dimensional vector spaces.
2. You require low-latency and high-throughput performance.
3. You need automatic horizontal and vertical scaling to handle large-scale deployments.
4. Your use case involves real-time recommendation systems, anomaly detection, similarity search in large-scale datasets, content-based recommendations, or AI-powered search features.
